 * view_receipt.php
 * 
 * This page is responsible for viewing a single, existing receipt.
 * It acts as a "controller" to fetch all necessary data from the database.
 * 1. Gets the receipt ID from the URL.
 * 2. Fetches the main receipt details from the `receipts` table.
 * 3. Fetches the partner's company name from the `partners` table.
 * 4. Fetches all associated payments from the `receipt_payments` table.
 * 5. Bundles all this data into a single array (`$receipt_data`).
 * 6. Includes the `create_receipt.php` template to render the final HTML.
